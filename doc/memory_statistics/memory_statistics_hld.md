## Overview

This High-Level Design (HLD) document explains the Memory Statistics feature in SONiC. The aim is to improve memory monitoring and management to optimize network performance and reliability.

## Introduction

This HLD document introduces the Memory Statistics feature in SONiC, enhancing its native memory monitoring capabilities. Effective memory management is crucial for network performance and stability. Previously, administrators relied on third-party tools, increasing OPEX and operational burdens. The Memory Statistics feature integrates comprehensive memory monitoring into SONiC, providing historical data through the CLI. Key benefits include:

- **Streamlined Troubleshooting:** Facilitates rapid identification of memory usage anomalies that could indicate potential resource bottlenecks or memory irregularities.
- **Detailed Memory Analysis:** Offers in-depth insights into memory usage patterns, allowing administrators to optimize resource allocation and usage effectively.
- **Proactive Maintenance:** Enhances the ability to detect and address memory-related issues quickly, ensuring reliable system performance.

## Proposed Behavior and Design

This section explains how Memory Statistics feature works, focusing on user control and straightforward interaction.

### Feature Overview

- **Feature Scope:** Memory Statistics feature offers a systematic approach to monitoring system-wide memory usage. It automatically records crucial metrics such as Total Memory, Used Memory, Free Memory, Available Memory, Cached Memory, Shared Memory and Buffers. 
- **Configurability:**  This feature offers customizable options for data collection frequency and the duration of data retention according to their specific operational needs. By default, the system is configured to collect memory at all times and sample it every 5 minutes and retains this information for 15 days , ensuring a balance between granularity and storage management.
- **Enable/Disable Functionality:** This feature is disabled by default to conserve system resources , suiting various administrative preferences but can be easily enabled to ensure continuous monitoring.


### Feature Specification

#### Data Collection and Storage

Memory Statistics utilizes a dedicated daemon process for the continuous collection of memory data. This process operates in the background, ensuring minimal impact on system performance. Data is stored in compressed log files within the system, optimizing storage usage while ensuring data is easily retrievable for analysis and reporting.

#### User Interaction

User interaction with the Memory Statistics feature is designed to be straightforward and efficient, utilizing a set of powerful CLI commands that enable administrators to manage and analyze memory data effectively.The CLI interface includes commands for:

- **Viewing Memory Statistics:** Users can view memory data over custom time intervals with `--from` and `--to` options for defining the start and end times. This allows for flexible and targeted data analysis.
  - **Default Memory Overview:** For a quick general overview without specific parameters, the default command displays system memory statistics covering the last 15 days. This will provide a summary of crucial metrics such as Total Memory, Used Memory, Free Memory, Available Memory, Cached Memory, Shared Memory and Buffers, ideal for routine checks.
- **Selecting Specific Memory Metrics:** This feature enables users to choose specific memory metrics to display, such as Total Memory or Free Memory, which helps in focusing on relevant data points and reducing output clutter.
- **Configuring Data Collection and Retention:** Administrators can adjust the frequency of data collection and the duration of data retention through commands and can specify how long to retain the collected data for.
- **Enabling/Disabling the Feature:** To adapt to different operational requirements, users can enable or disable the Memory Statistics feature as needed.
	
### Functional Requirements

- Support for Python psutils package to collect system memory data
- Support for CLI commands for displaying memory information

### Architecture Design

The overall SONiC architecture will remain the same. However, the following updates and additions will be implemented:

- **Daemon Process:**
	- **memorystatsd:** A new system daemon process that will be implemented to gather and log memory statistics.
	- **hostcfgd:** The existing host config daemon will monitor changes in the ConfigDB's `MEMORY_STATISTICS_TABLE` and will reload the `memorystatsd` service to apply the new settings.

- **Log File Directories:** Supporting log file directories will be established via SONiC Buildimage.
- **SONiC Utilities Updates:** Changes will be made in the SONiC Utilities container to add new "show" and "config" commands.
- **New Configuration Table:** A new table, MEMORY_STATISTICS_TABLE, will be added to ConfigDB to store memory-stats configuration parameters.
The high-level feature design diagram is shown below.

### Daemon Configuration Management

The `memorystatsd` will dynamically manage its configuration using the `hostcfgd`. The design will:

1. **Read Configuration at Startup**: On startup, `memorystatsd` process will read its configuration directly from the ConfigDB to initialize its settings.
2. **Monitor ConfigDB for Changes**: `hostcfgd` will monitor the `MEMORY_STATISTICS_TABLE` in ConfigDB for any changes to the configurations.
3. **Signal Daemon to Reload Configuration**: When configurations are updated via CLI and written to ConfigDB, hostcfgd will detect these changes and signal `memorystatsd` process to reload its configuration.
4. **Reload to Apply Changes**: `memorystatsd` process will reload its configurations upon receiving the signal and apply the new settings.

**Workflow for Configuration Management**

1. **Initial Setup**: On deployment, default settings are written to the ConfigDB.
2. **Daemon Startup**: `memorystatsd` reads configuration from ConfigDB and initializes its parameters.
3. **Runtime Configuration Changes**: Administrators update settings via CLI, which writes changes to ConfigDB.
4. **Monitor ConfigDB for Changes**: `hostcfgd` detects changes in ConfigDB.
5. **Signal Daemon to Reload Configuration**: hostcfgd signals `memorystatsd` to reload its configuration.
6. **Reload Daemon**: `memorystatsd` process reloads the configuration to apply the new settings.


## SAI API

No SAI API change or addition is needed for this HLD.

### Config DB Enhancements

A new table, `MEMORY_STATISTICS_TABLE`, will be introduced in `ConfigDB` to store the configuration settings of the Memory Statistics feature. This table will allow for management of data collection frequency, retention period, and enable/disable status. The relevant configuration parameters and the schema for this table are detailed below.

**MEMORY_STATS Configuration Parameters**

| Parameter           | Type        | Description                                                    |
|---------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| enabled             | boolean     | Enable or disable memory statistics collection.                |
| sampling_interval   | unit16      | Interval for memory data collection.       		     |
| retention_period    | unit16      | Duration for which memory data is retained.		     |   

**Config DB Schema**
```json

MEMORY_STATS_TABLE: {
    "MemoryStats": {
        "enabled": "true",
        "sampling_interval": "5",
        "retention_period":  "15"
    }
}
``` 


## Configuration and Management

### CLI/YANG Model Enhancements

#### CLI Commands

To configure the interval for memory data collection, use the following command:

	admin@sonic:~$ config memory-stats sampling-interval <interval>
 Default sampling-interval is 5 minutes

**Adjust the Data Retention Period**

	admin@sonic:~$ config memory-stats retention-period <period>
 Default retention-period is 15 days

**Enable/Disable Memory Statistics Monitoring**

To enable or disable the memory statistics monitoring feature, use the following command:

	admin@sonic:~$ config memory-stats enable/disable
 By default, it is disabled.

**View Memory Usage**

To display memory usage statistics, use the following command with optional parameters for time range and specific metrics:

	admin@sonic:~$ show memory-stats [--from <date-time>] [--to <date-time>] [--select <metric>]

**Command Definition**
  - **show memory-stats:** Display basic memory usage statistics
  - **--from <date-time>:** Display memory statistics from the specified start date-time.
  - **--to <date-time>:** Display memory statistics up to the specified end date-time.
  - **--select <metric>:** Display specific memory statistics, such as total memory.

 **Sample Output for Memory Usage**
